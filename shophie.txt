```
🚙→ meeting with Liran🎖️, Ovi🪨

trim → sand textured, painted trim. install, caulk, cover, spray→ smooth finish
countertops overhang ¼" because wavy procelain edges
default mirror choices
  buy mirror through liran, 🔬 vanity mirror edge finish
  master: wall to wall
  2F, 1F: move up for 8" backsplash
  optional→ try one LED mirror, but requires electrical work
shower pan: liran suggested octant pattern
grout lines are tiny 1/16"
talked about designers being useless and difficult to work with. no specs
basement flooring plan: aqua-guard F&D website

contradictions 🌟
  off-center drain explanation doesn't make sense

tasks 🥝
  ☒  present centered vs π/4 rotation square drain
  ☐ prepare list of purchasable bathroom hardware. links, $ spreadsheet
    sinks! liran's is 18.5" x 12" inside, but kohler is measured outside
    $200-250 vs kohler's $400-440
  ☐ 🔬 sink overhang. get exact measurement from ovi. ask underside polish
    flush mount vs tiny negative reveal.
    silicone color: clear kitchen, white bathrooms
  ☒ decide on hand shower for bathtub
  ☐ take photo of laundry room back for pipe placement
  ☐ double check already-installed posi-temp moen valve with shower specs
  ☐ find out sink widths, maybe from old photos
  ☐ choose laminate for garage entryway
  ☐ make sure minor floor repairs are done before installation of trim

I asked about
  front door exterior + interior paint
    exterior: sand prime tape paint
  ovi will measure master bathroom toilet room cabinet
    give rough estimates → 3 levels of quality (wood, doors, shelves)
  price breakdown over phone because Liran said 30K covered all quartz

need to ask about
  → rip out remaining wire shelving in laundry room, master closet



hey Ovi,

I wanted to apologize to you for asking so many questions and getting so involved with the process. I was an (unwilling) homeowners association president for several years and am used to working very closely with all sorts of experts - roofers, arborists, painters, plumbers, you name it. This is the first time I've worked with a general contractor so I completely did not follow proper etiquette and overstepped boundaries.

Liran told me I got you into trouble because we went into too much detail after he couldn't make the meeting and you tried your best to answer my questions in his stead. I tried to take responsibility. I know you were trying your best to help me out. Just wanted to say I appreciate that and sorry for what happened.

If you have questions about being a dad or encouraging your kids to love learning (and coding) please let me know =)

[1910]→	revisions and confusion regarding extra work order: $59,700
	30,000	quartz countertops and enclosures:
				master bathtub, shower, 2F vanities
				kitchen island + perimeter, 1F vanity

			includes $4,500 for carpet:
				2 stairs, bedroom, master bed+closet, 3F
				+ 3 outlets in master closet
	        includes $4,500 tub undermount: build new platform

	15,000	composite decking with railings
				total cost 10-15K depending on railing choice
				can use wood lattice paint match to TREX choice
	 2,000	composite porch platforms: top and bottom
	 1,600	basement painting: $1,200 painting, $400 paint, two coats
	 			miscommunication - was $1,200 but forgot paint cost

	48,600	total so far
			missing $11,100?


	not included in extra work order:
	   180		per door painting, air spray
	 3,200		ballpark quote: replace water heater if necessary
	 			2F kids vanity waterfall
	 			fireplace mantle


In-person meeting with 🎖️Liran, then follow-up phone calls. Liran showed samples. Ovi brought many stone samples and talked in detail about wet room and free standing tub options. They both urged having contrast in the kitchen island.
	1. Painting 0F walls and ceiling. $1200
	2. All countertop related work + carpets, electrical in master closet: 30K. Three side enclosure + glass door, undermount acrylic tub with quartz surround and waterfall, plumbing adjustment for tub, master vanity counter, second bathroom counter.
	3. I need to approve a design for some sort of groutless shower pan that can somewhat match the quartz.
	4. Deck is 14-15K. Small platforms on porch are 2K.
	5. Opening up master bathroom ceiling to see if we can replace smaller ducting with 6" to lower fan noise: undetermined cost if it requires a lot of additional work.

Note that doing the deck now will save 4-5K as opposed to doing it as a separate project. Doing the countertops now all together saves 4K in just labor: 9 vs 5.

[1916]→	walkthrough meeting with liran

🏭 todo
	⚠ careful about too focused on details. 1F transitions are problematic
	🔬 garage finishing ideas
	🔬 built-in shelving
	🔬 flush stair nose, transitions: floating floors need movement
		maybe it's fine as long as it's installed properly
	remove all blinds. wrap → garage
	save newer carpet for 1F?
	call junk removal service to independently remove trash bags
	research master bathroom photos. ex: wainscoat
		mozaic shower bed
		undermount tub
		barn doors seem dumb. cleaning, extra clutter

	send liran's updated proposal to brian for sales tax processing

improvements over base shophie
	trim and baseboard completely redone +paint. fixes all damage, bad repairs
	master bathroom → fan, vanity, shower enclosure, tub, tub tile
	ripping out IKEA cabinets in master closet

learned 🌜
	baseboards are installed like new construction. nail → caulk → paint
	master closet conversion to small closet + study is bad for resale
		better to add electrical, use as study
		demo of existing IKEA closets makes room enormous
	liran recommends best panasonic silent fan in every fan area
	full wall mirror is too big and 'feels off'
	tile in bathroom is 12x24
	grout isn't a big deal; materials are better now. seal to maintain
		mosaic tile uses grout lines as nonslip grip
	decking material is trex. take extra boards! like tile to replace D:

main reconstruction
	master bathroom remodel → fans, vanity
	remove IKEA closet system while redoing carpet

major projects
	flooring → look into cork, engineered hardwood, acoustic underlayment
		🔗 laminate flat transition youtu.be/bX7rcACGdcI
		carpet to match master bedroom in 2F, 3F, and 2-3 flights of stairs
		0F ← full refloor: cork
		1F, 2F hallway full refloor to laminate with no raised transitions
			or engineered hardwood
			🔧 consider better transitions, replacement of damaged edge boards
		1F carpet transition needs to be flawless, parallel
	master closet ← add electrical: 2-3 outlets
	replace ventilation fans in
	 	laundry closet
	 	1F bathroom
	 	2F bathroom
	 	master bathroom enclosed toilet section
	deck ← trex. discuss styles, railing, privacy screen
	garage ← small flooring project with stairs
		is it even possible to make the concrete stairs and wall bottom smooth?
			goal is easy to clean

small odds and ends
	paint all doors and frames the same color as trim; possible new hardware
	paint and spot repair railings when trim paint is being done
	water heater check by plumber while he's there
	1F replace damaged laminate floorboards
	possibly match vanities in 2F bathroom, 1F half bathroom

inconsistencies
	liran said closet study conversion was a good idea at first
		but after 2nd walkthrough noted: probably poor resale value
	emphatic about removing master vanity, then opened up keeping it



07:50 am Friday, September 23, 2022
[?...]-	hardwood loft?
[?...]-	servpro review
